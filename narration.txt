The New York Knicks adjusted their roster this offseason, balancing continuity with targeted additions.
They moved on from select depth pieces while adding players designed to complement Jalen Brunson’s playmaking.
The team’s defensive identity remains central, with hopes that improved spacing will lift the half-court offense.
If health cooperates and the new pieces fit quickly, New York should remain near the top of the East and have a credible path to a deep playoff run.
